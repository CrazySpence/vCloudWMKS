This example was made with the 2.1 WMKS SDK using the vCloud PHP 5.5 SDK to populate the ticket information

If you have the PHP SDK you can populate the config.php with your installations information to test the console. 

Please note this is meant as an example as there is no decent vCloud example provided in the zip or docs. This script uses HTTP GET
and ignores SSL certs it is not meant for production. Just an example.
